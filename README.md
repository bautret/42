# Hi there :wave:

**[Here are the projects](https://github.com/bautret/42/tree/main/Core_Curriculum)** I worked on at 42 *(Berlin campus)*.

I stopped after the 1st project at 42 *(Berlin campus)*: **[Libft](https://github.com/bautret/42_Core_Curriculum/tree/github/Libft)** to focus on my role at **numa**.

## Advice

1. Be consistent *(have a schedule)*.
2. Have a plan. <br />
    a. Read the PDF.  <br />
    b. Understand the tasks and write them down.  <br />
    c. Write your research done along the way *(a draft, no need to be clean)*.  <br />
    d. Code, test, refine, retest etc.  <br />
    e. Push and get evaluated.  <br />

**Don't compare yourself**, but seek for help and help whenever you can.

## Tester

To make your life easier, I recommend installing **francinette** which will help you test functions and spot mistakes.

To do so :
1. Copy and paste the **[francinette_install.sh](https://github.com/bautret/42_Core_Curriculum/blob/github/francinette_install.sh)** document in your root repository *(e.g.: 42_Core_Curriculum)*.
2. Execute the file with the command line: **bash francinette_install.sh**.
3. Go to your project repository *(e.g.: Libft)*.
4. execute the command: **francinette**.
5. See the magic happens.

# 42-Piscine-Berlin

**[Backup of my work](https://github.com/bautret/42/tree/main/Piscine)** during the selection process aka "piscine" of 42 Berlin in September 2023.

Few tips:

1. Learn to navigate in the **terminal** *(pwd/ls/cd/touch/rm)* in advance.

2. Know the **git commands** *(clone/git add/git commit/git push)*.

3. There is one way and it is the **norminette** way.

4. **Train** for the exams: [https://grademe.fr/](https://grademe.fr/) *(keep at least half a day per week to focus on this, my advice is to focus on the exam fron thursday afternoon)*.

5. **Sleep** enough.

6. Do the much **evaluations** you can *(split your day between deep work and evaluations)*. The earliest you start, the best it is *(great way to learn and less stress to get evaluated yourself)*.
